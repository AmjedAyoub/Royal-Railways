# Royal-Railways

## Introduction

This system was built assuming that Jordan uses trains as public transportation in its’ 12 main cities. The program is theoretically for users to view and book train trips to travel within the country. Users have options to schedule multiple trips in one ticket allowing them to choose between economy, business, and first-class seats. The program has a back-end access by employees of the train transportation company to input schedules of trains, modify existing trains or trips, enabling them to notify customers of updates, delays, and issues regarding their trips. Managers can manage employees’ access rights to the program to restrict access to the confidential accounting and managerial side of the company where they are able to manage employees’ salaries and the business financial performance.
